      "description": "My father, Ramkumar, is a strong pillar in our small family of four. He has always been a beacon of hope and strength. His zest for life, hardworking attitude, and ever-present smile, even in the face of adversity, are truly inspiring. But today, his health has taken a downturn, and he needs your urgent help.This July, my father began experiencing agonizing stomach pains. Initially, we believed it to be a recurring kidney stone problem, and he tried his trusted Ayurvedic cure. But this time was different. His condition soon deteriorated, with acute blood vomiting and clotted masses. While my distraught mother and I dealt with the mounting issue, I took him to the nearest hospital. I vividly remember the hospitable scene of crimson-laden floors and my father turning pale each moment.\n \n\n \nOur insurance claim was denied due to pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. My father owned a wood carving business but was forced to shut it down due to his weak health. My mother is a housewife, and my sister is still studying. Recently, I also embraced fatherhood, but our joy was clouded by complications during my wife's pregnancy. Our precious little one was born prematurely, requiring extensive medical care. To support my family, I depleted my savings during this challenging period. Now, I have spent my remaining savings and resorted to a  personal loan to initiate the critical treatment my father needs.A seems to be the only way forward, and this will cost us Rs. 25,00,000. There is no way I can arrange for this amount, and I need your help arranging for the required amount; you can do so by donating to this fundraiser.\n \nI request, from the depths of my heart, that you come forward and support us in this trying time. Your contribution, no matter how small, can make a significant difference in my father’s battle against this liver disease. You can further help me by sharing this fundraiser on various social media platforms and in your circles. Everything you do will make a difference to us.Medical investigations revealed a dire situation—his liver, affected by long-term portal hypertension, had developed cirrhosis. The ruptured portal veins were causing internal bleeding, necessitating immediate intervention. The recommended Endoscopic Variceal Ligation (EVL) treatment, a series of procedures, became our lifeline. Rs. 8,00,000, liver transplant.I thank you for supporting us through this difficult time. Our family is grateful for each of your efforts. Please continue to support us through this journey. We are greatly thankful for your help and kindness.",

Abhishek, at 43, was the epitome of health and vitality before this cruel twist of fate.  after being initially taken to Manipal Hospital Emergency because of acute dyspnea and low oxygen levels.

On January 8, 2024, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and was put on a ventilator in the intensive care unit Unfortunately, on February 6, 2024, following four weeks in the intensive care unit, he experienced a cerebral stroke.The doctors are hopeful of his recovery because of his healthy medical history. Yet this is delayed due to his weakness from pneumonia.The prolonged care that he needs is accompanied by an estimate of Rs 20 lakh for his treatment.Funding the remaining Rs. 20 lakh is impossible and has left us with no option but to seek crowdfunding.As a housewife with an 8-year-old daughter to care for, the burden of managing the escalating medical expenses has become overwhelming. We have exhausted our savings and, with the help of our family, spent over Rs. 24 lakh to pay for the medical bills so far.Every donation brings Abhishek one step closer to returning home.  With your help, he can get his second chance at life with us.Please donate generously, as fellow humans, to support us in our darkest hour.
